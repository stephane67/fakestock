Simulate a low product stock to trigger the visitor's purchase.

== Description ==

Scarcity is one of the most important trigger to increase sales.

Sometimes we want to tell the visitor that there are only a few products left, but most ecommerce plugin doesn't allow that. Fake stock makes this possible.

You define  :
- a minimum stock,
- a decrease speed,
- and a restocking day (every month or every monday). 

Then, you just have to paste the maximum stock using the shortcode where you want it to appear: on a product page, in an article, in the menu...

Stock decrease is automated to avoid any "fake stock effect".

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

e.g.

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/plugin-name` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
1. Use the Settings->Plugin Name screen to configure the plugin
1. (Make your instructions match the desired user flow for activating and installing your plugin. Include any steps that might be needed for explanatory purposes)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
